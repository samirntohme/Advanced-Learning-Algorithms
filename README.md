ML files from Stanford’s course

This repository contains the files from Stanford University's Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification course, of the Machine Learning specialization. <br>

The files implement the following topics:
• Build a neural network that can perform classification on an image
• Use a framework, TensorFlow, to build a neural network for classification of an image
• Build a neural network in regular Python code (from scratch) to make predictions
• Build neural networks that use parallel processing (vectorization) to make computations faster
• Train a neural network on data using TensorFlow
• Build a model with various activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU, and linear)
• Build multiclass classification
• Build a model that uses categorical cross entropy loss function for multiclass classification
• Build a model that uses the recommended method for implementing multiclass classification in code

Running the Jupyter Notebook Files
To run the .ipynb files make sure you have the prerequisites and then follow the installation steps.

Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
Python (>=3.7 recommended)
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

Installation:

Clone the repository (if not already done):
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

This will open Jupyter in your default web browser. Navigate to the directory containing the .ipynb files and open the desired notebook.

Alternative: Run in Jupyter Lab (optional, if installed):
jupyter lab
