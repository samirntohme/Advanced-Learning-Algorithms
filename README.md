ML files from Stanford’s course

This repository contains the files from Stanford University's Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification course, of the Machine Learning specialization. <br>

The files implement the following topics: <br>
• Build a neural network that can perform classification on an image <br>
• Use a framework, TensorFlow, to build a neural network for classification of an image <br>
• Build a neural network in regular Python code (from scratch) to make predictions <br>
• Build neural networks that use parallel processing (vectorization) to make computations faster <br>
• Train a neural network on data using TensorFlow <br>
• Build a model with various activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU, and linear) <br>
• Build multiclass classification <br>
• Build a model that uses categorical cross entropy loss function for multiclass classification <br>
• Build a model that uses the recommended method for implementing multiclass classification in code <br>

Running the Jupyter Notebook Files <br>
To run the .ipynb files make sure you have the prerequisites and then follow the installation steps. <br>

Prerequisites: <br>
Make sure you have the following installed on your system: <br>
Python (>=3.7 recommended) <br>
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab <br>

Installation: <br>
1. Clone the repository (if not already done): <br>
git clone <repository_url> <br>
cd <repository_name> <br>

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended): <br>
python -m venv venv <br>
source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux <br>
venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows <br>

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: <br>
jupyter notebook <br>

This will open Jupyter in your default web browser. Navigate to the directory containing the .ipynb files and open the desired notebook. <br>

Alternative: Run in Jupyter Lab (optional, if installed): <br>
jupyter lab
